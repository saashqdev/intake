# Service Overview

Services are the core units of deployment and management within dFlow. Whether
it's a backend API, a database, or a containerized app, each service is
represented with detailed configuration, environment variables, logs, deployment
history, and domain settings.

dFlow currently supports the following service types:

- [**App Service**](./app) – Deploy directly from Git providers like GitHub,
  GitLab, or Bitbucket.
- [**Docker Service**](./docker) – Deploy prebuilt Docker containers.
- [**Database Service**](./database) – Managed or self-hosted databases.

Each service type has a dedicated interface tailored for its unique
configuration and operational needs. Use the links above to explore each service
type in detail.
