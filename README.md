# Open Self Service (O2S)

**Framework for building composable customer self-service portals.**

**Open Self Service** is an open-source development kit that simplifies the creation of self-service frontend applications by integrating multiple headless APIs into a scalable frontend.
Its flexibility allows for many customizations and lets you build various types of composable frontends.

## 🚀 Key Features

- **Composable** – In short: **API-agnostic**. Compose customer experience by combining multiple "backend capabilities" into seamless, fully decoupled frontend.
- **Next.js Frontend Starter** – Robust Next.js-based frontend including basic customer portal pages and content management capabilities.
- **API Harmonization Server** – **Integration layer** for data aggregation, orchestration and normalization. Provides vendor lock-in safeness and better maintainability.
- **TypeScript SDK** – Easily interact with the Harmonization Server in the frontend app or any web, mobile, other TS-based apps.
- **Pre-built Integrations** – Ready integrations so that you can set up your solution faster.
- **Extensibility** – Customize UI components, add new pages, add new API integrations, adapt to your needs.

O2S follows a **monorepo structure** using **Turborepo** for managing apps and internal packages.

```sh
/apps
  /frontend             # Next.js frontend
  /api-harmonization    # API Harmonization Server (NestJS)

/packages
  /ui    # UI component library (shadcn/ui, Tailwind)

Hey everyone!

We’ve just published a new Medusa plugin that might be useful for those of you building B2B customer portals or after-sales platforms.

Medusa Assets & Services Plugin
It extends Medusa with support for:
Assets (e.g. purchased products with serial numbers assigned to a customer)
Service Instances (e.g. paid service plans assigned to purchased items or customers)

These models are often needed in B2B use cases where customers need to track and manage their products or services post-sale. Now you can manage them directly in Medusa!

The plugin was developed as part of our open-source project Open Self Service - a composable frontend framework for customer portals… but the plugin can be used standalone in any Medusa-based solution.

👉 Check it out: https://github.com/o2sdev/medusa-plugin-assets-services
📦 NPM: https://www.npmjs.com/package/medusa-plugin-assets-services
🔍 Open Self Service website: https://www.openselfservice.com

Happy to answer any questions or get your feedback!

PS.
You like our solution, its architecture or stack and would like to use it as a headless storefront for Medusa that is CMS-managed and flexible to connect other APIs?

Currently Open Self Service is missing e-commerce features but we could adjust our roadmap. If this direction aligns with your needs, let us know via contact@openselfservice.com or DM.
