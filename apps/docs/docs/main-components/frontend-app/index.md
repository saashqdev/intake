# Frontend app

The **frontend app** in Open Self Service is a high-performance, modular application built with **Next.js** and designed to serve as the foundation for composable customer portals. It provides a ready-to-use structure, pre-configured features, and customizable pages to accelerate development and deliver seamless customer experiences.

## Pages included in the app

The frontend app comes with pre-built pages to cover common customer portal functionalities. These pages can be extended or modified as needed.

The initial feature set of O2S was designed based on Gartner’s research on Customer Self-Service Capabilities: https://www.gartner.com/en/customer-service-support/topics/self-service-customer-service.
This research outlines the core functionalities required for effective self-service solutions, as illustrated in the image below.
