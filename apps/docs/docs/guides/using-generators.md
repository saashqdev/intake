# Using generators

To make the process of adding new components we have prepared several generators using [Turborepo code generation features](https://turbo.build/repo/docs/guides/generating-code).

You can launch these generators by running

```shell
npm run generate
```

at the root level of the project, after which you will be asked which generator you want to use.

## API Harmonization

### Block

You can create a new block within the `api-harmonization` app by using `api-block` generator. It will:

1. Create a new folder in the `apps/api-harmonization/src/block` directory.
2. Inside this new folder, it will create all the necessary files that compose a module:
    - module,
    - controller,
    - service,
    - mapper,
    - model and request.
3. It will also add this new block to the `app.module.ts` file inside the `imports` section so that Nest.js could include it.

## Frontend

### Block

To create a new block within the `frontend` app, you can choose the `frontend-block` generator. It will:

1. Create a new folder in the `apps/frontend/src/containers` directory.
2. Inside this new folder, it will create all the necessary files that compose a container:
    - server component,
    - client component,
    - renderer,
    - typings,
    - API methods,

## UI

To create a new container within the `ui` package, you can choose the `ui-component` generator. It will:

1. Create a new file in the `packages/ui/src/components` directory.

---

## Integrations

You can also create a whole new integration by using the `integration` generator, which will:

1. Ask you which modules you want included in the integration.
2. Create a new folder in the `packages/integrations` directory.
3. Initialize a new project for this new integration, with all the necessary files (like `package.json`, linter and prettier configs, and so on).
4. For each module you chose, it will create appropriate folder within the `packages/api/integrations/src/module` directory.
5. Inside those folders it will create the necessary files that compose a module:
    - controller,
    - service,
    - mapper.
